    "-   This lecture reviews some Python programming essentials. Not exciting, but necessary for many students. \n",
    "-   There are many programming paradigms, but in data science, we typically use the *procedural programming* approach: We write a *script* file, containing a sequence of instructions, which we pass to an interpreter, which carries them out in real time as we iterate.\n",
    "    -   Imagine writing a \"script\" for a play: You name the characters (objects), you give them lines and tell them what to do (expressions, functions), and the director makes it all happen (control structures, interpreter)\n",
    "-   By contrast, for example, in *object oriented programming*, you design an abstraction of an object that a user will interact with through a variety of methods: For example, one object in Excel is a spreadsheet, and the programming revolves around how the user interacts with spreadsheets."

    "## Ordered Collections: Indexing\n",
    "- When you have an ordered object, like a string or tuple or list, you can easily make selections from it by indexing\n",
    "- Here we run into a bit of an issue: Python starts *indexing* elements in ordered collections from 0, not 1\n",
    "- *Indexing is not counting* (in Python, C, etc., versus languages that index from 1, like R, FORTRAN, MATLAB, etc.)\n",
    "- This means that the \"first\" element in a tuple corresponds to index number 0, the \"second\" element corresponds to index number 1, and so on. \n",
    "- You can think of selecting the n-th element from `x` by typing `x[n-1]`, but at this point you have to make the psychological shift to thinking of `x[0]` as the first element and thinking directly of `x[n]` as the $n-1$-st element of `x` "
